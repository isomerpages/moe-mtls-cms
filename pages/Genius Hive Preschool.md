<p style="font-size: 21px;font-family: KaiTi;">     Genius Hive Pre-school坚信，幼儿在学校、家庭及社区快乐地使用华语与人沟通，可培养他们学习华语的兴趣。本校与家庭、社区合作，课程以幼儿全面发展为目标，以幼儿为主体设计学习活动。</p>
<p style="font-size: 21px;font-family: ">除了课堂教学， “晨间散步”、“文化欣赏”、“事件简述” 和 “国际交流” 等活动也能激发幼儿的好奇心，培养幼儿的批判性斯文，拓展他们的视野。</p>
<p  style="font-size: 20px;font-family:Lato,sans-serif;">Genius Hive Pre-school believes that children learn languages best through their daily experiences in school, at home, and in their surroundings.  Young children can relate to such experiences which makes learning meaningful, active, and enjoyable to them.  Our holistic curriculum focuses on planned, child-oriented activities that involve both parents and the community.  Besides classroom activities, we engage our children in morning walks and cultural appreciation activities.  Children are also exposed to current issues and engage in international exchange programmes that extend their experiences, curiosity and sense of inquiry beyond our local context.</p>
