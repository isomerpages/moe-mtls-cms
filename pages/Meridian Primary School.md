<p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: KaiTi;">   为了提高学习兴趣，促进母语学习，感受华文华语的奥秘，美廉小学创立了独特的母语室——“秘密花园”。“秘密花园”提供了利于学习华文的空间，让学生参与一系列真实的学习体验，例如“美廉购物日”、“美廉游戏日”、“美廉招聘日”等，让学生从学习体验中开展语文探索之旅，从而乐学华文，爱上华文。

<p  style="font-size: 20px;font-family:Lato,sans-serif;">To nurture the joy of learning and promote the use of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL), Meridian Primary School has turned the MTL room into a magical hideaway – “The Secret Garden”. This provides students with authentic experiences in learning Chinese language, as they engage and explore in a stimulating environment. Students immerse in activities such as “Shopping Day”, “My Hobbies Day” and “Recruitment Day”. These activities excite students about learning while cultivating their interest and love for Chinese Language. </p>
