<p>MTLS is an annual event co-organised by MOE, the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), the Malay Language Learning and Promotion Committee (MLLPC) and the Tamil Language Learning and Promotion Committee (TLLPC). 2021 marks the 10th anniversary of MTLS.</p>
<p>This year, MTLS will be a hybrid event featuring both physical and online components.</p>
<p>After nine iterations, MTLS has established its own branding and achieved its intended outcomes considerably. It is an annual event that many children, parents, community partners and MTL educators look forward to.</p>
